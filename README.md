# JobFinder App

JobFinder is a responsive job hunting application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. This app helps users search and filter job listings based on various criteria such as location, job type, and job mode.

## Features:

React Context API is used to manage global state and avoid prop drilling, making data easily accessible across components.

Integrated Fetch API to retrieve job listings dynamically.

Search functionality allows users to find jobs by keywords.

Filter options let users narrow down results by location, job type (e.g., full-time, part-time), and job mode (e.g., remote, on-site).

A dedicated Saved Jobs page where users can bookmark jobs to view or apply later.

This project demonstrates efficient state management and modern frontend development practices, ideal for improving job search experiences.
